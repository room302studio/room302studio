      <h4>Ukraine Grain</h4>

        We designed an interactive tool that uses government and COMTRADE data to model the potential impact of war in
        Ukraine on global grain supplies. Using sophisticated data visualization techniques, we mapped out what a %
        reduction in output would mean for Ukraine's total grain production and its downstream consumers. The result was
        an engaging, scroll-based app that made complex data accessible and intuitive.

        In a series examining environmental justice's impact on different communities, we created interactive
        scroll-powered maps. Our maps innovatively combined historical redlining maps with satellite imagery for web use.
        The visualizations served as compelling narratives illustrating how environmental justice dynamics affect people's
        lives.

        This award-winning project involved creating an interactive StreamGraph for UNHCR, demonstrating refugee flows
        over time. The project allowed viewers to navigate through rich datasets by isolating each origin or destination,
        providing an immersive and enlightening exploration of refugee movements.
