      <h4>Mapping Environmental Justice</h4>
      <h5>Client: The Margin</h5>

        In a series examining environmental justice's impact on different communities, we created interactive
        scroll-powered maps and visualizations for <strong>The Margin's</strong> five inaugural stories.</p>

      <p>Our visualizations included timelines, historical redlining maps, and a scroll-powered tour of the Skagit River.
        The visualizations served to enhance the compelling narratives illustrating how environmental justice dynamics
        affect people's
        lives.

        This award-winning project involved creating an interactive StreamGraph for UNHCR, demonstrating refugee flows
        over time. The project allowed viewers to navigate through rich datasets by isolating each origin or destination,
        providing an immersive and enlightening exploration of refugee movements with an innovative visualization.

        Transforming an abstract concept into a tangible solution, Room 302 Studio architected and developed an innovative
        MVP for Noan, a pioneering business co-pilot. Our work encompassed the full breadth of the app, strategically
        converting a non-technical vision into a dynamic AI platform employed for advanced language model generation.</p>

      <p>Complementing our rapid prototype development, we spearheaded the creation of proprietary IP. Our ground-breaking
        CMS solution, fueled by Storyblok, empowers non-technical users to swiftly create strings of prompts, streamlining
        operational efficiency. Leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4 at the onset of its introduction, we stand testament to our
        capacity to harness emerging technologies speedily and effectively.

      <h4>Ukraine Grain</h4>
      <h5>Client: The Plotline</h5>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        We designed an interactive tool that uses government and COMTRADE data to model the potential impact of war in
        Ukraine on global grain supplies. Using sophisticated data visualization techniques, we mapped out what a %
        reduction in output would mean for Ukraine's total grain production and its downstream consumers. The result was
        an engaging, scroll-based app that made complex data accessible and intuitive.
