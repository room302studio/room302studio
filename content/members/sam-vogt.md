Sam Vogt is an experienced visual designer with a focus on meaningful data narratives and visualization. Sam worked his way into visualization projects starting as an illustrator and brand designer, learning to encode organizational values in the elements of visual communication.

From there it was a surprisingly short jump to the world of data visualization because, after all, both disciplines share foundational principles such as integrity, accessibility, and emotional resonance - and both strive to turn information into action.
