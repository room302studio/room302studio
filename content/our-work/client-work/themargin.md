Mapping Environmental Justice

Client: The Margin

https://themargin.us/

In a series examining environmental justice's impact on different communities, we created interactive scroll-powered maps and visualizations for The Margin's five inaugural stories.

Our visualizations included timelines, historical redlining maps, and a scroll-powered tour of the Skagit River. The visualizations served to enhance the compelling narratives illustrating how environmental justice dynamics affect people's lives.
