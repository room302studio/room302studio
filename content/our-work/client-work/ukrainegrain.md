In the wake of the conflict in Ukraine, the world faced a looming crisis — the threat to global grain supplies. In partnership with Earthrise Media for The Plotline, we undertook the mission of translating the complexities of agricultural supply chains and the impacts of war into an interactive tool that can be used both by experts and the general public.

**Understanding and Translating Data**

The foundation of this project was the data — detailed agricultural figures provided by the Ukrainian government. The data came in Ukrainian, a language barrier that posed our first challenge. Accuracy in translation was paramount, as the integrity of the entire project hinged on the reliability of this data.

**Designing the Interactive Experience**

With accurate data in hand, the next hurdle was design iteration. How could we make a sophisticated data set not just understandable but engaging? 

We developed a series of prototypes riffing on an interface that allowed users to manipulate the data themselves, adjusting the output of grain from each Ukrainian oblast to see the potential impact on exports. 

To provide affordances for experts and novices alike, we introduced "shortcut" buttons, enabling scenarios like reducing all Eastern oblasts to a certain percentage with a single click. These shortcuts served as an educational tool, allowing users to quickly understand how varying degrees of conflict could affect global grain distribution.

**Innovative Features for Enhanced Engagement**

We wanted to take things a step further and explore the downstream effects of these changes. Connecting the Ukrainian data with COMTRADE information on global grain consumption, we enabled a real-time view of how alterations in Ukrainian output would impact different countries.

**Collaborative Efforts for a Unified Message**

Our collaboration with The Plotline's editorial team was crucial. The narratives they crafted around climate change and global agriculture needed to be supported and amplified by our visualizations, not overshadowed. Through a process of continuous iteration and feedback, we ensured that our interactive tool not only complemented but also deepened the impact of their storytelling.
