## Project Overview:
The Wildlife Conservation Society approached us with an exciting, meaningful challenge: to spotlight the resilience of coral reefs in the face of climate change. Their research had uncovered a ray of hope amidst a critical situation. While many coral reefs are threatened by rising temperatures, some have shown remarkable adaptability. These resilient reefs fall into three categories - those in cooler areas avoiding bleaching, those that have evolved to withstand hotter temperatures, and those accustomed to frequent bleaching but recover quickly.

## Objective:
Our mission was clear and compelling: to identify these bastions of hope and advocate for their protection. This project was not just about mapping coral reefs; it was about mapping a future where these vital ecosystems continue to thrive. For NYC Climate Week and the United Nations General Assembly, we were tasked with creating a digital data visualization experience. This would not only educate but also inspire action. The goal was to create an interactive map showcasing examples of each resilient reef type. Users could click on a reef, immerse themselves in stunning visuals, and learn about its unique survival story.

## Call to Action:
The project culminated in a powerful call to action, inviting the global community to join in this vital conservation effort. It was an opportunity to turn data into a compelling narrative, fostering a connection between the public and the underwater worlds we seldom see but desperately need to protect.
