We partnered with the Wildlife Conservation Society on an interesting and vital challenge: to bring to light the resilience of certain coral reefs in the throes of climate change. 

**From Research to Action**

Our collaboration began at the intersection of science and digital storytelling. We dove into the Society's extensive research, a treasure trove of data revealing how some reefs are not just surviving but thriving against the odds. The challenge was twofold: to ensure each visualization remained true to the scientific rigor of the WCS's findings, and to translate this data into a format that would captivate and educate a diverse audience and inspire action.

**Crafting the Piece**

The design journey was as complex as the ecosystems we aimed to represent. How do you take robust scientific data and render it into an engaging, interactive digital canvas? Our team embarked on a design iteration odyssey, creating prototypes that would allow users to navigate through the resilience of coral reefs with intuitive ease. The result was an interactive map, an atlas of hope, detailing each reef's unique story of survival against climate change.

**User Experience and Engagement**

To foster an environment of learning and exploration, we implemented features that allowed for both deep dives and overviews. Users could select individual reefs, revealing a world of vibrant visuals and compelling stories about their survival strategies. The experience was layered, offering different paths of interaction to engage both the seasoned conservationist and the curious layperson.

**The Key Conservation Narrative**

Our endeavor went beyond mere data visualization; it was a combination of conservation narratives, with the WCS's scientific expertise and our storytelling background working in harmony. The iterative process, punctuated by feedback loops with the scientists and stakeholders ensured that our digital storytelling amplified the WCS's call for action without compromising on scientific integrity.

**Launch and Impact**

Timed with NYC Climate Week, the interactive site made its debut, casting a spotlight on these resilient reefs. It served as an educational platform, igniting conversations among conservationists, policymakers, and the public, and serving as a digital clarion call to rally the global community around the vital cause of preserving our planet's coral reefs.
