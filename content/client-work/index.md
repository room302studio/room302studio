## Mapping Environmental Justice
### Client: The Margin

In a series examining environmental justice's impact on different communities, we created interactive scroll-powered maps and visualizations for The Margin's five inaugural stories.

Our visualizations included timelines, historical redlining maps, and a scroll-powered tour of the Skagit River. The visualizations served to enhance the compelling narratives illustrating how environmental justice dynamics affect people's lives.


## UNHCR Refugee Data Visualization
### Client: United Nations Refugee Agency

This award-winning project involved creating an interactive StreamGraph for UNHCR, demonstrating refugee flows over time. The project allowed viewers to navigate through rich datasets by isolating each origin or destination, providing an immersive and enlightening exploration of refugee movements with an innovative visualization.


## Ukraine Grain
### Client: The Plotline
https://stories.theplotline.org/ukr-grain/

We designed an interactive tool that uses government and COMTRADE data to model the potential impact of war in Ukraine on global grain supplies. Using sophisticated data visualization techniques, we mapped out what a % reduction in output would mean for Ukraine's total grain production and its downstream consumers. The result was an engaging, scroll-based app that made complex data accessible and intuitive.
